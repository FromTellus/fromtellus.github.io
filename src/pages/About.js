        Born in 1987 at Stockholm, Sweden.
        <br />
        <br />
        With an interest in all things technical from a young age.
        <br />
        <br />
        My first bout with programming was running and hosting a private MMORPG
        shard of Ragnarok Online as a teenager.
        <br />
        <br />
        I learned some C++, MySQL and PHP in the process.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then my carrer shifted towards coordination, project management and
        training of staff on IT systems and applications.
        <br />
        <br />
        I felt detached from actual technology and started taking classes in
        programming at Komvux.
        <br />
        <br />
        Completing two courses that focused on HTML, CSS and Javascript, two on the subject of
        C# and one on PHP.

        Then came <b>{"</ Salt >"}</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        I had followed their newsletter for about two years before I felt the
        time was right and I applied.
        <br />
        <br />
        The stars aligned, I got accepted and completed their three months
        {"( pretty intense )"} bootcamp in Javascript.
        <br />
        <br />
        And I feel I have found <b>home</b> in my return to programming and development.
